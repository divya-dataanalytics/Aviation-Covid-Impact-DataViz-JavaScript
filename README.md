Commercial aviation has a direct impact on our nationâ€™s economy, creating more than 10 million well-paying American jobs and driving 5 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product and nearly $1.7 trillion in annual economic activity. Healthy U.S. airlines stimulate the commercial aviation industry, as well as the broader economy through increased connectivity, trade and enhanced mobility of people, cultures, goods and ideas.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to travel restrictions and a slump in demand among travellers. Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in flights being cancelled or planes flying empty between airports, which in turn massively reduced revenues for airlines and forced many airlines to lay off employees. Some have attempted to avoid refunding cancelled trips in order to diminish their losses.

Multiple airlines waived fees for flight booking changes and cancellations during the coronavirus outbreak. Flight fares for domestic flights also dropped. On 25 March, the United States Senate passed a bill that would allocate $58 billion in loans and guarantees to aviation-related companies, including $25 billion for passenger carriers and $4 billion for cargo carriers, plus $17 billion for companies "critical to maintaining national security", such as Boeing.
